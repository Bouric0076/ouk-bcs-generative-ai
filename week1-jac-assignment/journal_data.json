      "response": "It sounds like you're really struggling right now. Losing a friend can be one of the hardest experiences, especially when it involves betrayal. \n\nFirst of all, allow yourself to feel the emotions that come with this situation. It's okay to be upset and to process your feelings. Remember that your emotions are valid and it's normal to feel hurt.\n\nIt might also be helpful to talk to someone about what happened. This could be a trusted family member, a friend who hasn't betrayed you, or even a professional counselor. Sharing your story with someone who cares about you can help you feel heard and understood.\n\nIn the meantime, try to take care of yourself. Get enough sleep, eat well, and engage in activities that bring you joy. This can be anything from reading a book, watching a movie, or going for a walk. Do things that help you relax and take your mind off the situation.\n\nYou might also want to try to practice self-compassion. Be kind to yourself and remind yourself that you didn't deserve to be betrayed. You are not to blame for what happened and you are worthy of love and respect.\n\nLastly, remember that time heals all wounds. While it may not feel like it right now, things will get better with time. You will heal and you will come out stronger on the other side.\n\nKeep in mind that you are not alone in this and that you are loved and supported.",
